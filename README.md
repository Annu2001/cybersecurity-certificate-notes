# Cybersecurity notes

Miscellaneous notes during study for [Google's Cybersecurity Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/google-certificates/cybersecurity-certificate).

## Note on notes

I typically only note things that I suspect I'll forget, or that don't make sense immediately. As such, my notes are only a small subset of the course's full content.

Each folder is a "course", each numbered `.md` within is a "module". For example, my notes on course 1, module 1, [are here](/1%20Foundations%20of%20Cybersecurity/1%20Welcome%20to%20the%20exciting%20world%20of%20cybersecurity.md).

Finally, there's informal feedback scattered throughout, this is just a reminder to myself for a planned end-of-certificate review!
